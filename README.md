◈ NutanX: The Student Command Center
Unified. Localized. Autonomous.

NutanX is a next-generation "One-Stop Solution" designed to eliminate student "App Fatigue." By consolidating academic resources, secure utility tools, and real-time campus data into a single Cyber-Navy themed dashboard, NutanX empowers students to manage their campus life with tactical efficiency.

🚀 The Mission
Modern campus life is fragmented across dozens of portals, PDFs, and group chats. NutanX serves as a centralized hub, mapped specifically to the NMVPM (NMIET) Autonomous 2025 Pattern, ensuring that every student has their "Academic Command Center" just one click away.
